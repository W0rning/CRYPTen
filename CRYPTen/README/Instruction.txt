What do with a files, you mean yeah?
So enCRYPTen is an encrypting file, this file crypting ALL THE FILES will be in crypting_files folder. You may remember it.
All the folders with all the files.
Ok. You run the program. There is the "> Enter password to encrypt:". You may enter the password, you can't pass it.
If you don't need the password, just put it to .txt file, and when time is come you use this key.
And yes, you can pass it:)
Just click ENTER when program is starting, and when starting decrypt program you may do the same.
All the crypting and decrypting history will be show in the console. (in the future is will put to .txt file)
THAT IS ALL! And check README before start the program!
